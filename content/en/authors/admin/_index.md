  I am a student of Applied Informatics at Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. I was born and live in Moscow. In my first year, I actively searched for myself, tried my hand at various areas of IT and came to the conclusion that my goal was to acquire such skills in order to become a sought-after specialist in the field of data collection and analysis.
   I am engaged in data analysis using the Python programming language, R and their libraries. I actively study English, because it has any necessary information.
