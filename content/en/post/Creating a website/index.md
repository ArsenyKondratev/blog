## Review

A website is a document posted on the Internet. Documents are called web pages, they are interconnected and have a common structure. Each page is written in a programming language and using markup. Simplistically, this is called the site code or just the code. The most common programming languages are PHP and JavaScript.

Before you create a website, you need to decide what it will be and why you need it. Development will go faster if the structure and sections of the site are pre-drawn on a piece of paper. That's what the sites look like.

A landing page is a targeted one—page website. This is also called a landing page or promo page. As a rule, landing pages are built according to the same scheme: a memorable title, information about a product or service, photos and one or more feedback forms. Landing pages are most often used for advertising campaigns.

A good promo site encourages visitors to leave contacts or immediately order a product or service.

A portfolio website or business card is a multi-page or one—page website about the achievements, experience, knowledge and examples of the work of its owner. With the help of a portfolio, you can show off and attract new customers.

A corporate website is a multi—page and multi-level website where you can find complete information about the company, its management, products and history. Corporate websites attract new customers and retain old ones.

An information site is a site with the latest news. As a rule, there are a lot of text articles here.

A social network, a forum, is a multi—page site where users post short posts and exchange messages. Usually such sites can be scrolled endlessly, because there are a lot of published posts.

An online store is a multi-level, multi—page website similar to a regular store. First, the customer finds the right product and its description, and then he can buy it and arrange delivery or pickup. There are also online stores on social media platforms.
